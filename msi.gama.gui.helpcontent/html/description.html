		<h1>GAMA</h1>
		<h2><font color="blue">Description</font></h2>
		<div>
			<b>GAMA</b> is a simulation platform, which aims at providing field experts, modellers, and computer scientists with a complete modelling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit multi-agent simulations. It has been developed by the research team MSI (located in the IFI, Hanoi, and part of the IRD/UPMC International Research Unit UMMISCO) since 2007.<br/><br/>
			The most important requirements of spatially explicit multi-agent simulations that GAMA fulfils are:
			<ul>
				<li>The ability to use complex GIS data as an environment for the agents.</li>
				<li>The ability to handle a vast number of (possibly heterogeneous) agents.</li>
				<li>The ability to offer a platform for automated controlled experiments (by automatically varying parameters, recording statistics, etc.).</li>
				<li>The possibility to let non-computer scientists design models and interact with the agents during simulations.</li>
			</ul>
			Beyond these features, GAMA also offers:
			<ul>
				<li>A complete XML-based modeling language, GAML, for modeling agents and environments</li>
				<li>A large and extensible library of primitives (agent's movement, communication, mathematical functions, graphical, ...)</li>
				<li>A cross-platform reproducibility of simulations</li>
				<li>A powerful and flexible plotting system</li>
				<li>An user interface based on the Eclipse platform</li>
				<li>A complete set of batch tools, allowing for a systematic or "intelligent" exploration of models parameters spaces</li>
			</ul>

					<td>The version 1.2 of GAMA has been released. This version improves the stability (especially for executing "huge" models), the responsiveness of user interface, the efficiency of memory occupation, the execution speed, the inter-operability (in reading and writing files), the visualization of models, and the compliance of GAML language to XML specification. Besides these enhancements, GAMA 1.2 introduces three new features: (1) a mecanism of contribution to attributes; (2) a capability of drawing agents using geometric representation (2D), permitting to represent more finely the spatial interactions between agents; (3) a multi-level language capable of initializing dynamically agents composing others agents and working with several levels of representation (of agents) in the same model.

It incorporates several changes, including an XML editor coupled with the simulator, the possibility to take snapshots of every graphical window, save parameters and monitors for future reuse, save charts as CSV files, and definitely fixes the memory leaks observed in previous versions.

Right now, we are updating both the metamodel and the parser (with a new, and hopefully easier to input, syntax for the language, as well as a dedicated editor).

There have been some delays in the development of this version, but we hope we'll be able to release it sometime during the summer.</td>

Please download the software again if you are using these features (and likely having troubles). The debugged source code is available, as well, from the CVS server.</td>

			<h2><font color="blue">Downloads</font></h2>
		 
			<p>GAMA runs on almost any current computer, the only constraint being the amount of memory available (some models may need up to 2GB of free memory to run)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Windows: Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, NT, ME, and 98.</li>
				<li>Mac OS X: Mac OS X 10.4 (or newer) is recommended, but 10.3 and 10.2 should also be supported. Please run Software Update to ensure that you have the latest Java Runtime Environment (1.5 required).</li>
				<li>Other platforms: GAMA should work on any platform on which a Sun Java Virtual Machine, version 1.5 or later, is installed. However, regarding the Linux distributions, we strongly recommend Ubuntu.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The current usable (and mainly stable) version of GAMA is version 1.2 alpha. Please download the distribution that corresponds to your operating system:</p>
			<ul>
