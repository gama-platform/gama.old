1.  Use of Software and License. Subject to the terms of this
    Agreement SourceClear grants to Recipient a
    nonsublicensable, nonexclusive license to use the Software
    solely in accordance with, and during the term of, this

    Recipient shall not (and shall not allow any third party to)
    reproduce or modify the Software or any portion thereof.
    Recipient shall not rent, sell, lease or otherwise transfer
    the Software or any part thereof or use it for the benefit

    reverse compile or reverse engineer the Software, or
    otherwise attempt to discover any Software source code.


    SourceClear reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
    modify this Agreement at any time by posting a notice on its
    website, and/or by notifying Recipient via email.  Recipient
    shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar
    with any such modifications.  Recipient’s use of the
    Software following such notification constitutes Recipient’s
    acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
    modified.


2.  Support and Upgrades. This Agreement does not entitle
    Recipient to any support, upgrades, patches, enhancements,
    or fixes for the Software (collectively, “Support”). Any
    such Support for the Software that may be made available by
    SourceClear shall be subject to a master services agreement
    or other written and mutually signed documentation between
    Recipient (or Recipient’s employer) and SourceClear.


3.  Indemnity.  Recipient agrees that SourceClear shall have
    no liability whatsoever for any use Recipient or any third
    party makes of the Software. Recipient hereby agrees to

    attorney’s fees) arising from claims related to Recipient’s
    use of the Software.


4.  Feedback. Recipient may, at its discretion, provide
    feedback to SourceClear with respect to its use of the
    Software (“Feedback”).  Feedback may include, without
    limitation, errors or difficulties discovered in the
    Software and the characteristic conditions and symptoms of
    the errors and difficulties. Unless specifically agreed in
    writing, Feedback provided by Recipient shall not create any
    confidentiality obligation for SourceClear, and SourceClear
    shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or
    otherwise distribute, and exploit such Feedback as it sees
    fit.


5.  Warranty Disclaimer.

    SOURCECLEAR PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, AND SOURCECLEAR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES
    RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF
    THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


6.  Limitation of Remedies and Damages. 

    SOURCECLEAR SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT
    TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT,
    NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY (A) FOR LOSS OR
    INACCURACY OF DATA OR (EXCEPT FOR RETURN OF AMOUNTS, IF ANY,
    PAID TO SOURCECLEAR HEREUNDER) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
    SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, OR (B) FOR ANY
    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUES AND LOSS OF PROFITS.
    SOURCECLEAR SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND
    ITS REASONABLE CONTROL.


7.  Nonassignability. Although fully assignable and
    transferable by SourceClear, neither the rights nor the
    obligations arising under this Agreement are assignable or
    transferable by Recipient, and any such attempted assignment
    or transfer shall be void and without effect.


8.  Effective Date, Controlling Law, Attorneys' Fees and
    Severability. This Agreement shall become effective only
    upon Recipient’s clicking the “I Accept” or “Submit” button
    (as applicable) or Recipient’s download or first use of the
    Software, whichever is earlier, and it shall be governed by
    and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
    California without regard to the conflicts of laws
    provisions therein. In any action to enforce this Agreement
    the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and
    attorneys' fees. In the event that any of the provisions of
    this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of
    competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions
    shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
    necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in
    full force and effect and enforceable.


9.  Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any
    agreement, policy or guideline referenced in this Agreement
    (including without limitation any master services agreement
    between Recipient (or Recipient’s employer) and
    SourceClear), constitutes the complete and exclusive
    statement of all mutual understandings between the parties
    with respect to the subject matter hereof and the Software,
    superseding all prior or contemporaneous proposals,
    communications and understandings, oral or written. To the
    extent there is any conflict between this Agreement and such
    mutually executed master services agreement, the master
    services agreement shall prevail. Except as expressly
    provided herein, any modifications of this Agreement must be
    in writing and signed by both parties.


10. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by
    SourceClear for any reason or no reason upon five (5) days'
    written notice to the Recipient, or immediately upon notice
    of any breach by Recipient of the provisions of this
    Agreement. Upon termination, the license granted hereunder
    will terminate and Recipient shall immediately destroy any
    and all documents, notes and other materials regarding the
    Software (including any physical copies made thereof), and
    an officer of Recipient shall certify the same to
    SourceClear upon SourceClear’ request; otherwise, the other
    terms of this Agreement will remain in effect.


11. Export Controls. Recipient shall comply with all
    export laws and restrictions and regulations of the
    Department of Commerce, the United States Department of
    Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), or other
    United States or foreign agency or authority, and not to
    export, or allow the export or re-export of the Software in
    violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations. By
    downloading or using the Software, Recipient agrees to the
    foregoing and Recipient represents and warrants that
    Recipient is not located in, under the control of, or a
    national or resident of any restricted country or on any
    such list.


12. Basis of Bargain. EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT
    THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY
    LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR
    BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO
    ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE
    GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION
    BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
